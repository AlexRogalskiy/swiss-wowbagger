# swiss-wowbagger
Let yourself be insulted in swiss german.

Inspired by kthxbye's [figgdi](http://figgdi.kthxbye.ch/) and Franz Hohler's [Totemügerli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQi0lsUs8J4).

This is also a [kotlin multiplatform](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/11/kotlin-1-2-released/) project, so the same code is used to produce both .class files and javascript.

And it's a gradle project that publishes to maven central. (Why is this so hard?)
