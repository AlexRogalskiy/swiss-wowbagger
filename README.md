Let yourself be insulted in swiss german.
Inspired by kthxbye's [figgdi](http://figgdi.kthxbye.ch/).

This is also a [kotlin multiplatform](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/11/kotlin-1-2-released/) project, so the same code is used to produce both .class files and javascript.

And it's a gradle project that publishes to maven central. (Why is this so hard?)
